# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)



# 25.times do
#   p = Project.create!(
#     title: Faker::App.name,
#     description: Faker::Lorem.paragraph,
#     goal: rand(100000),
#     start_date: Time.now.utc - rand(60).days,
#     end_date: Time.now.utc + rand(10).days
#   )
